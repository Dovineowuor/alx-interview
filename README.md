# ALX-INTERVIEW

This repository contains a collection of projects that showcase my skills and abilities in various programming concepts and languages. Each project is designed to demonstrate my understanding of a specific topic and my ability to apply that knowledge to solve problems.

## Project List
- [`0x00-pascal_triangle`](0x00-pascal_triangle): A Python function that generates Pascal's triangle of a given size `n`.


[0x01-lockboxes](0x01-lockboxes): A Python function that generates a Triangle


[`0x02-minimum_operations`](0x02-minimum_operations): A Python function that calcu;lates the minimum operations of a given task

[`0x03-log_parsing`](0x03-log_parsing): A function that parses a string into a list of tokens and returns a list of tokens


[`0x04-utf8_validation`](0x04-utf8_validation): A Python function that validates a string into a list of tokens and returns true if it is valid UTF-8 encoded string and false otherwise

<!-- - `0x01-rotate_image`: A Python function that rotates a given image by 90 degrees.
- `0x02-linked_list`: A Python implementation of a singly linked list data structure.
- `0x03-graph_algorithms`: Python implementation of various graph algorithms such as Breadth First Search and Depth First Search.
- `0x04-dynamic_programming`: Python implementations of various dynamic programming algorithms such as Longest Common Subsequence and knapsack problem. -->

## How to use
Each project has its own README file that explains how to use and run the code.

## Contributions
If you find any bugs or have any suggestions for improvements, please feel free to submit an issue or a pull request.

## Note
This repository is a representation of my skills and abilities at the time of creating the repository. The code present here is not production ready and is intended for demonstration purposes only.
