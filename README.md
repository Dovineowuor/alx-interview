# alx-interview

This repository contains a collection of projects that showcase my skills and abilities in various programming concepts and languages. Each project is designed to demonstrate my understanding of a specific topic and my ability to apply that knowledge to solve problems.

## Project List
- `0x00-pascal_triangle`: A Python function that generates Pascal's triangle of a given size `n`.
<!-- - `0x01-rotate_image`: A Python function that rotates a given image by 90 degrees.
- `0x02-linked_list`: A Python implementation of a singly linked list data structure.
- `0x03-graph_algorithms`: Python implementation of various graph algorithms such as Breadth First Search and Depth First Search.
- `0x04-dynamic_programming`: Python implementations of various dynamic programming algorithms such as Longest Common Subsequence and knapsack problem. -->

## How to use
Each project has its own README file that explains how to use and run the code.

## Contributions
